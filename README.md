### 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m Karan Kumar Maurya — a developer focused on building technology that protects and empowers.  
I specialize in creating real-time, safety-focused applications using **AI, IoT**, and **mobile-first systems** that respond when it matters most.

From apps that track live location via **BLE and Firebase**, to platforms with **live chat, push alerts, payments**, and **instant help desk**, I build full-stack solutions that are fast, scalable, and human-centered.

🧠 What I bring to the table:
- Expertise in **real-time & safety-critical systems**
- BLE, GPS, Firebase-based **location tracking**
- Integration with Stripe, Razorpay, Twilio, FCM
- Full-stack dev using **Flutter, React, Node.js, Firebase, MongoDB**
- Focus on **usability, latency, and scale**

> 💡 I believe that tech can be more than just smart — it can save lives. I build every line of code with that in mind.
